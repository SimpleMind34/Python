One <adjective> morning, <name> woke up to find a <animal> dancing on their <furniture>.

"Time to <verb>!" shouted the <animal>, wearing a tiny <clothing_item>.

Confused but curious, <name> grabbed a <noun> and followed it to <place>.

There, they saw a group of <plural_noun> doing the Macarena around a giant <silly_object>.

"Only you can stop the <absurd_event>!" yelled the mayor, who was actually a <job_title> in disguise.

So <name> took a deep breath, did a <funny_dance>, and saved the day.

Everyone cheered and gave <name> a golden <noun> filled with <plural_food>.

The end. Or is it?
