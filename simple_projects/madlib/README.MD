## This game is super fun:

just gather your friends, tell each one to suggest a word, mix it all up, and enjoy!

If you don't have the imagination to create stories, then just ask an AI model to generate them for you, **_make sure that you mention that the words you will enter in the story will be between <>_**

### Here are some examples:

I included 2 stories:

- story 1 demo:
  \*\*One smart morning, Lia woke up to find a wolf dancing on their chair.
  "Time to going!" shouted the wolf, wearing a tiny skirt.

Confused but curious, Lia grabbed a girl and followed it to park.

There, they saw a group of boys doing the Macarena around a giant hair brush.

"Only you can stop the wedding!" yelled the mayor, who was actually a nurse in disguise.

So Lia took a deep breath, did a jumba, and saved the day.

Everyone cheered and gave Lia a golden girl filled with pizzas.

The end. Or is it?\*\*

- Story 2 demo : \*\*On a bloody night in haunted forest, Max heard a strange screaming outside.

Grabbing a shoootgun, they tiptoed past the bloody portraits and opened the creaky hair clip.

Suddenly, a bloody vampire in a red cape appeared and hissed, "Give me your rest!"
Before Max could scream, a wild werewolf crashed through the basement, howling and eating a chocolate.
Before Max could scream, a wild werewolf crashed through the basement, howling and eating a chocolate.

The vampire and werewolf started arguing over who got to kill Max first.

Thinking fast, Max threw a poppit and shouted, "I am actually a nine tales fox!"

Both monsters gasped, bowed, and ran off into the eclipse.

From that day on, Max became known as the ruler of the bats.

The end unless you hear a hissing tonight. \*\*

Overall, just have fun, get together doing so... Peace!
